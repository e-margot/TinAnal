# TinAnal

Dependences of some parameters (like smoking, hobbies) on age were identified based on the questionnaires of 500 women and more than 500 men in the popular Tinder application.

The analysis of the photographs of the respondents was carried out using a neural network. Some classes (hips, necline, torso) were labeled manually.
